Name: EZComplete
Author: i0s_tweak3r
Description: A CLI terminal based version of an openai chatbot for jailbroken iOS devices.  It accesses the models directly using Objective C instead of Python or Node, making it kind of a unique package, and an ideal framework for building into a tweak or application once finished. Note:The tool does require python to be installed so it can interact with the API. 
Depends: firmware (>=8.0)

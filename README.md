# EZComplete
A working, highly customizable GPT-3 client for use on any command line interface on jailbroken iOS devices.  (Scope is small, I know, going to add OSX soon, and work on an application 
to give it a proper UI.) 

Makefile and a couple other files need configured to make a rootless build. This version is extra verbose,
since I used NSLog statements
for debugging and kept some of the extras for now. Oh yeah, this is written entirely in Objective C, no python, no node.js, that would be too easy, they have libraries with convenience functions.
